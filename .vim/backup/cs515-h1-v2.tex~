\begin{homeworkProblem}

Show that for any real constants $a$ and $b$, $b > 0$, that $(n+a)^b \in \Theta(n^b)$.

\problemAnswer{
    By the generalized binomial theorem, $(n+a)^b$ expands to $n^b + f(n)$, where $f$ is an infinte sum of terms starting with
    $abn^{b-1}$ and continuing with terms with ever-decreasing powers of $n$.

    Because $f$ is a polynomial of degree $b-1$ and any polynomial of degree $a$ grows strictly slower than a polynomial of degree
    $b$ when $a < b$. We know that $\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(n)}{n^b} = 0$, and: 

    \[\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{n^b + f(n)}{n^b} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{n^b}{n^b} + \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(n)}{n^b} = 1\]

    Thus $n^b + f(n) \in O(n^b)$. On the other side, we would like to prove that $n^b + f(n) \in \Omega(n^b)$ by showing:

    \[\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{n^b}{n^b + f(n)} = c, 0 < c < \infty\] 

    It's not immediately clear how we would even use L'Hopital's Rule here to show the above. Instead, consider that $f(n)$
    is asymptotically positive and of smaller degree than $n^b$. Therefore $n^b$ can't grow any faster than $n^b + f(n)$ so
    $n^b + f(n) \in \omega(n^b)$ and thus $n^b + f(n) \in \Omega(n^b))$.

    So, $n^b + f(n) \in O(n^b)$ and $n^b + f(n) \in \Omega(n^b)$. Thus, $n^b + f(n) = (n+a)^b \in \Theta(n^b)$.}
