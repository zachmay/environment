\begin{problem}[3.1-2]
    Show that for any real constants $a$ and $b$, $b > 0$, that $(n+a)^b \in \Theta(n^b)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    By the generalized binomial theorem, $(n+a)^b$ expands to $n^b + f(n)$, where $f$ is an infinte sum of terms starting with
    $abn^{b-1}$ and continuing with terms with ever-decreasing powers of $n$.

    Note that $n^b + f(n)$ is not strictly a polynomial when $b$ is not an integer, but it suffices to know that the fastest-
    growing term of $f$ is of the form $cn^{b-1}$, which does indeed grow slower than $n^b$. From this, we know that:
    \[\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{n^b + f(n)}{n^b} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{n^b}{n^b} + \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(n)}{n^b} = 1 + 0 = 1\]

    Thus $n^b + f(n) \in O(n^b)$. On the other side, we would like to prove that $n^b + f(n) \in \Omega(n^b)$ by showing:
    \[\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{n^b}{n^b + f(n)} = c, 0 < c < \infty\] 

    It's not particularly clean to use L'Hopital's Rule here when $b$ is not an integer. Instead, consider that $f(n)$
    is positive (following from the definition above), so $n^b$ can't grow any faster than $n^b + f(n)$. Therefore,
    $n^b + f(n) \in \Omega(n^b))$.

    So, $n^b + f(n) \in O(n^b)$ and $n^b + f(n) \in \Omega(n^b)$. Thus, $n^b + f(n) = (n+a)^b \in \Theta(n^b)$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[3.1-4]
    Is $2^{n+1} \in O(2^n)$?  Is $2^{2n} \in O(2^n)$?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    To show that $2^{n+1} \in O(2^n)$, consider the following limit:
    \[\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2^{n+1}}{2^n} = \lim_{n \to \infty}2 = 2 \]

    Because $0 < 2 < \infty$, we know $2^{n+1} \in O(2^n)$. As for $2^{2n}$, consider:
    \[\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2^{2n}}{2^n} = \lim_{n \to \infty}2^n = \infty\]

    Therefore $2^{2n} \in \omega(2^n)$ so $2^{2n} \not\in O(2^n)$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[3.2-1]
    Show that if $f$ and $g$ are monotonically increasing functions then so are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{$f(n) + g(n)$}
        \item{$f(g(n))$}
        \item{$f(n)g(n)$; $f$, $g$ are non-negative}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{$f(a) \le f(b)$ and $g(a) \le g(b)$, so $f(a) + g(a) \le f(b) + g(b)$, so $f(n) + g(n)$ is monotonically increasing.}

        \item{$g$ is monotonically increasing and $a \le b$ so $g(a) \le g(b)$. Therefore, because $f$ is monotonically increasing,
            $f(g(a)) \le f(g(b))$. Therefore, $f(g(n))$ is monotonically increasing.}

        \item{Because $f$ and $g$ are non-negative and monotonically increasing, we know that where $a \le b$, $0 < f(a) \le f(b)$ and
            $0 < g(a) \le f(b)$. Thus $f(a)g(a) \le f(b)g(b)$ so $f(n)g(n)$ is monotonically increasing.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[3.2-4]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Is the function $f(n) = \lceil \lg n \rceil!$ polynomially bounded?}
        \item{Is the function $g(n) = \lceil \lg \lg n \rceil!$ polynomially bounded?}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    By definition a function $h$ is polynomially bounded if $h \in O(n^k)$ for some constant $k$,
    or, equivalently, that there exist constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that for all $n \ge n_0$,
    $h(n) \le cn^k$.

    If we take $\lg$ on both sides (and merge the constant factors) we get that 
    $\lg h(n) \le c \lg n$, so $\lg h(n) \in O(\lg n)$. Therefore, $\lg h(n) \in O(\lg n)$
    entails $h(n)$ is polynomially bounded.

    Now, let us assume that $f(n)$ is polynomially bounded. Then there exist constants $c$, $k$, and $n_0$ such that
    for all $n \ge n_0$:
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \lceil \lg n \rceil!      &\le& cn^k    \nonumber \\
        \lg(\lceil \lg n \rceil!) &\le& c \lg n \nonumber 
    \end{eqnarray}

    Equation $3.19$ in the text gives $\lg(n!) \in \Theta(n \lg n)$. We're not dealing directly with $\lg(n!)$, though.
    What we do have is of the form $\lg(u!)$ where $u = \lceil \lg n \rceil$. We can substitute $u$ into the above identity
    and then substitute the $\Theta$ term into the inequality above, since such substitution can only change the values of
    the above constants. Similarly, we can dispose of the ceiling operation, since $\lceil \lg n \rceil \in \Theta(\lg n)$
    (no matter how big $n$, the two will never differ by more than 1).
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \lg(\lceil \lg n \rceil!)                  &\le& c \lg n  \nonumber \\
        \lceil lg n \rceil \lg \lceil \lg n \rceil &\le& c \lg n  \nonumber \\
        \lg n \lg \lg n                            &\le& c \lg n  
    \end{eqnarray}

    Now we see the problem. No constant $c$ is larger than every value of $\lg n$, so (1) is a contradiction and
    our initial assumption that $f$ is polynomially bounded is false.

    Now we turn to $g(n) = \lceil \lg \lg n \rceil!$ We'll take a similar approach. If $g$ is polynomially
    bounded, there exists constants $c$, $k$, and $n_0$ such that for all $n \ge n_0$:
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \lceil \lg \lg n \rceil!       &\le& cn^k     \nonumber \\
        \lg(\lceil \lg \lg n \rceil!)  &\le& c \lg n  \nonumber \\
        \lg \lg n \lg \lg \lg n        &\le& c \lg n  \nonumber 
    \end{eqnarray}

    Because $\lg \lg n$ is asymptotically greater than $\lg \lg \lg n$, we can say:
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \lg \lg n \lg \lg \lg n   &\in& o((\lg \lg n)^2) \nonumber \\
                                  &=&   o(\lg^2(\lg n))  \nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}

    As the text proves, any polylogarithmic function is polynomially bounded, so $\lg \lg n \lg \lg \lg n$, having a strict upper bound
    that is itself polynomially bounded, must also be polynomially bounded.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[3.4]
    Let $f$ and $g$ be asymptotically positive functions. Prove or disprove the following conjectures:

    \begin{enumerate}[a.]
        \setcounter{enumi}{3}
        \item{$f(n) \in O(g(n)) \implies 2^{f(n)} \in O(2^{g(n)})$} \label{q34p1}
        \setcounter{enumi}{6} 
        \item{$f(n) \in \Theta(f(n/2))$} \label{q34p2}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    \textbf{Part d.}
    By hypothesis, $f(n) \in O(g(n))$, so there exist positive constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that for all $n \ge n_0$,
    $f(n) \le cg(n)$. In order to show that $2^{f(n)} \in O(2^{g(n)})$, we must find positive constants $d$ and $m_0$
    such that for all $n \ge m_0$: $2^{f(n)} \le d2^{g(n)}$.

    We note that since $f(n) \le cg(n)$, we can substitute:
    \begin{eqnarray}
        2^{f(n)}       &\le& d2^{g(n)}  \nonumber \\
        2^{cg(n)}      &\le&            \nonumber \\
        (2^{g(n)})^c   &\le&            \nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}

    Unless $c = 1$, $(2^{g(n)})^c$ will eventually outgrow $d2^{g(n)}$ for constant $d$, so we \textbf{can't} conclude that,
    in general, $f(n) \in O(g(n)) \implies 2^{f(n)} \in O(2^{g(n)}$.

    \textbf{Part g.}
    To show that $f(n) \in \Theta(f(n/2))$, we can show that (1) $f(n) \in O(f(n/2))$ and (2) $f(n) \in \Omega(f(n/2))$.
    In both cases, we will use L'Hopital's Rule, though this does add a restriction that $f$ is differentiable.
    \[\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(n)}{f(n/2)}
        = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\frac{d}{dn}f(n)}{\frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dn}f(n)}
        = \lim_{n \to \infty}2 = 2 \]

    Therefore, $f(n) \in O(f(n/2))$. On the other side:
    \[\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(n/2)}{f(n)}
        = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dn}f(n)}{\frac{d}{dn}f(n)}
        = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \]

    Therefore, $f(n) \in \Omega(f(n/2))$, and so $f(n) \in \Theta(f(n/2))$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[3.5]
    We say that $f(n) \in \Omega_{\infty}(g(n))$ if there exists a positive constant $c$ such that $f(n) \ge cg(n) \ge 0$
    for infinitely many integers $n$.

    Show that for any two asymptotically non-negative functions $f$ and $g$, either $f(n) \in O(g(n))$ or
    $f(n) \in \Omega_{\infty}(g(n))$ or both, whereas this is not true if we use $\Omega$ in place of $\Omega_{\infty}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    Our approach here will be to assume that both $f(n) \not\in O(g(n))$ \emph{and} $f(n) \not\in \Omega_{\infty}(g(n))$
    and then derive a contradiction.

    By hypothesis, then, there exist no choice of positive constants $c$, $n_0$, and $d$ such that at least one of
    the following holds:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{For all $n \ge n_0$, $f(n) \le cg(n)$.} \label{p35c1}
        \item{For infinitely many $n$, $0 \le dg(n) \le f(n)$.} \label{p35c2}
    \end{enumerate}
    But if (\ref{p35c1}) does not hold, which is to say $f(n)$ is less than or equal to a constant multiple of $g(n)$ for
    sufficiently large $n$, (\ref{p35c2}) must hold, because starting at some sufficiently large $n$, there are infinitely
    many values for $n$ (though possibly not all values of $n$) where $f(n)$ is greater than a fixed, positive, constant
    multiple, $k$, of $g(n)$, or formally, $0 \le kg(n) < f(n)$, which implies (\ref{p35c2}) (by definition, $f$ and $g$ are
    asymptotically non-negative).

    Our hypothesis was that neither (\ref{p35c1}) nor (\ref{p35c2}) are true, but (\ref{p35c1}) being false implies that 
    (\ref{p35c2}) is true. This is a contradiction, so one or more of (\ref{p35c1}) and (\ref{p35c2}) must be true.

    Returning to our standard definition of $\Omega$, $f(n) \in \Omega(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $c$ and $n_0$
    such that for all $n \ge n_0$, $f(n) \ge cg(n)$. In other words, after some fixed $n_0$, \emph{every} subsequent $n$ has
    $f(n)$ greater than or equal to a fixed, positive, constant multiple of $g(n)$. 

    But, consider the following function: 
    \[
      h(n) = \left\{ 
      \begin{array}{l l}
        2^n & \quad \text{if $n$ is even}\\
        1   & \quad \text{if $n$ is odd}\\
      \end{array} \right.
    \]
    We know $h(n) \in \Omega_{\infty}(2^n)$ because infinitely many even values of $h(n)$ are greater than or equal $2^n$,
    but $h(n) \not\in \Omega(2^n)$ because there's no fixed $n_0$ after which $h(n)$ is \emph{always} greater than or
    equal to $2^n$ (or any fixed multiple of $2^n$) since $h$ bounces back and forth.
\end{solution}
